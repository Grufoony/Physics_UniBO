Radiometry enables us to know what a pixel value implies about surface lighness and illumination. So radiometry links the effective brightness of an object point with the respective image point's pixel value. \\ \\
The amount of object coming out of an object, $f(x,y)$, can be expressed as 
$$
	f(x,y) = i(x,y)r(x,y)
$$
with $0 < f(x,y) < \infty$, $0 < i(x,y) < \infty$ and $0 < r(x,y) < 1$, where $i(x,y)$ is the light coming from the source and $r(x,y)$ is the object's reflectance. \\
$i(x,y)$ is determined by the light source, whereas $r(x,y)$ depends on the surface of the object. \\ \\
