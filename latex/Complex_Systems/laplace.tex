Laplace problem
You are tossing a coin. You get H with probability p and T with probability 1-p.The event $E$ is $n+1$ outcome, and $H_n$ is $\{x_1,x_2,...\}$, so the first is the future and the second is the past. \\
What is the probability
$$
	p(x_{n+1}=H | H_n) / ? % (nh + 1)/(N + 2)
$$
If we take the number of times where we get H, $n_H$, then we define $p$ as
$$
	p = \frac{n_H}{N}
$$
for $N > 1$.
