This model takes into account the fact that the higher the population is, the more resources are needed, so there should be a limit that can't be surpassed, because the environment wouldn't be able to sustain it
$$
	x_{n+1} = \alpha x_n(A-x_n)
$$
Now we change variable, defining $\hat{x} = x/A$, and we get
$$
	\frac{x_{n+1}}{A} = A\alpha \frac{x_n}{A}\left(1 - \frac{x_n}{A}\right)
$$
$$
	\hat{x_{n+1}} = r \hat{x_n}(1-\hat{x_n})
$$
which is the logistic map:
$$
	T(x) = rx(1-x)
$$
We take $x$ between $0$ and $1$ and $r$ between $0$ and $4$. The graph is a parabola upside down.
