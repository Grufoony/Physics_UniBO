An image sensor is made of millions of photosensitive sites, and each site converts light falling on it into electrical charge. The brighter the light, the higher the charge. Then the various levels of charge are converted to digital numbers. \\
An example of an image acquisition device is the scintillator. A scintillator is a detector that converts incoming ionizing radiation into visible light, and the visible light is then converted into an electric charge. \\ 



Image formats are characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item raster or vector type
	\item compressed or not compressed
	\item bit depth
	\item header information
\end{itemize}
Raster image formats describe shapes as patterns of dots or pixels, and each pixel contains data of its grey level (jpeg,git,raw,...), whereas vector image formats describe formats in an analytic way, defining images through curves and line segments (ps,eps,pdf).
