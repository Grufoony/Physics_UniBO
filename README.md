# Physics_UniBO
Repository for materials related to the master's degree course in Physics of the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna.
The repository is divided into two main paths:
## ./latex
Contains .tex files of courses
## ./utils
Contains some code/miscellaneous of courses

# How to contribute
You can upload anything you want by making a pull request, following many simple rules:
- you can download, modify existing .tex files (except the main.tex) as you want, uploading the changes
- every .tex file must be a chapter to be included in the main.tex file of a specific course
- avoid, if possible, to include images in .tex files. If you cannot avoid this, simply upload the images into the same folder as the .tex
